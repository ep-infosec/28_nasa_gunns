PURPOSE:   (Provides the classes for the GUNNS Fluid Flow Orchestrator.)

@details
REFERENCE:
- (TBD)

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS:
- ((Design limitation: closed loops of all overflowing nodes do not conserve mass & energy.)
   (Design limitation: conservation errors can occur from a link that flows both to & from an
   overflowing node with multiple flow paths.))

LIBRARY DEPENDENCY:
- ((GunnsFluidFlowOrchestrator.o))

PROGRAMMERS:
- ((Jason Harvey) (CACI NSS) (2018-04) (Initial))

/// @brief    GUNNS Fluid Flow Orchestrator Class.
///
/// @details  This orchestrates the flow transport between nodes through the links of a GUNNS fluid
///           network.  This is similar to basic networks except that in fluid networks, we must
///           update the links and nodes in the optimal order to help conserve mass & energy when
///           nodes are 'overflowing'.
///
///           A node is overflowing then there is more mass flow out of the node in a time step than
///           the amount of mass that was in the node at the start of the time step.  All of the
///           node's original mass is flowing out and being replaced by incoming flows, and some of
///           that incoming flow also flows through and out.  If a link transports its flows from
///           the node before the node's inflows and final state are known, then the fluid state
///           transported by the link is incorrect because it doesn't include the properties
///           (mixture and temperature) of the overflow fluid from the node's input.  This doesn't
///           conserve mass and energy.
///
///           We avoid the above problem by updating overflowing nodes before their outflow links
///           transport their flows.  To do so, we first have to update their inflow links, but then
///           those links must have their source nodes updated prior.  Some "chicken and egg" cases
///           occur where we can't determine an ultimate source node.  In these cases, we have to
///           force a link to transport before its source nodes are complete.  These cases are
///           described as design limitations in the Assumptions & Limitations, but all could be
///           avoided by proper network setup.
