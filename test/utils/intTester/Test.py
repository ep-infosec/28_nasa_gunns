       several individual tests within an integration test.

                          data logging for this test.  This should be set by the derived test class.
       testLogFileName    Stores the Trick data log path/filename so this test can open the log file
                          and test values within.  This is set automatically by the test suite.
       testLogData        A table of the Trick data log values, loaded from the data log file.  This
                          is updated automatically.
       testLogDataNumRows The number of data rows (recorded sim times) in the Trick data log, including
                          the header row.  This is updated automatically.
       testLogDataNumCols The number of data columns (recorded sim variables) in the Trick data log,
