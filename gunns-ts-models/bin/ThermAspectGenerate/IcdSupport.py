## @brief:
## The IcdSettings class is a simple data structure with no functions. It contains 3 types of
## dictionaries:
## (1) defines the category (xml tag) in the ThermRegistry of the icd job corresponding to each type
##     of thermal Gunns link; ex: <viewScalar> for rad read, <temperature> for cap write
## (2) defines the units associated with each category
## (3) defines the class members of the Thermal Gunns links that write/read the icd data
