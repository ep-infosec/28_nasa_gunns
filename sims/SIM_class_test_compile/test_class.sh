# the given class header file.  This assumes the following:
# - the given header file declares a class of the same name,
# - the class is not pure-virtual,
# - the class has a compilable default constructor.
#
# Invoke this script with a gunns/ -relative path to the class header file to test.
# Example:
# $ source test_class.sh aspects/electrical/Switch/GunnsElectUserLoadSwitch.hh
