# This script can rotate, scale, shift the x&y coordinates of paths
# from the draw.io shape edit schema.  Copy your shape's path from
# draw.io into the input_path.txt file, then run this script.
# The script outputs the transformed path to the console, which you
# can copy back into draw.io.
#
# Order of operations is rotate, then scale, then shift.
# Enter your transform amounts below.
#
# This assumes x & y fields are always enclosed in double-quote, i.e.
#   x="2.3", not x='2.3'
# This assumes there is always a y field immediately following an x field.
# TODO doesn't work with <arc> fields.
