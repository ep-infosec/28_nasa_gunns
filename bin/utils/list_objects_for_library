# This makes a list of .o files for all classes to be included in a GUNNS
# compiled library.  Each line is formatted with a tab in front and a \ in back
# for inclusion in a makefile rule, i.e:
#
#	./core/GunnsBasicSocket.o \
#	./core/GunnsFluidConservationData.o \
#
# Each grep -v <folder> section omits any classes from that folder.  Add more
# of these to add new folders to be omitted.
